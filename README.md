Research on the presence of sharks during the tourist seasons in middle Atlantic and south eastern coastal waters using data mining 


This analysis is to continue the research on the presence of sharks during the tourist seasons in middle Atlantic and south eastern coastal waters using data mining following the Cross Industry Standard Process for data mining(CRISP-DM). Our study will focus on the analysis of existing data from the International Shark Attack database, weather data from NOAA and calculated moon phase dates. Based on the understanding, a model will be built to uncover various interesting facts about the impact of environmental factors such as moon phases, wind speed and wind direction on creating the favorable conditions for the sharks near the shore. The results of the study could be used to predict the likelihood of Sharks near the shore which could be used as the basis for an application or dashboard which would serve as a warning system near coastal waters with higher plausibility of human activity such as swimming, fishing etc. The Shark Protection Organizations can also make use of such a warning system to take necessary preventive measures for protecting sharks from being slaughtered by humans and thereby saving them from possible extinction.
